"customer251.json","Absolutely wonderful food & service! Go there for lunch/dinner with my boyfriend at least once every two weeks. Prices are very much reasonable. Weekends get pretty packed so may have to wait a little bit but that's never an issue for us. Always get the Indian Pancake & the Hainanese Chicken or Curry Chicken. Other dishes are delicious as well. Never get tired of it!"
"customer252.json","Pretty slow service and the waitresses aren't very kind. I guess I was expecting something different at a diner with high ratings but I understand it's in the middle of a tourist area. However\, service should be a priority. Something that really bothered me was how much trash was left on the floor of the outside deck- it all has the potential to blow right into the ocean. NOT OKAY. I had to stand up several times to grab straw wrappers and napkins before they blew into the water. If you're going to have a waterfront/beach front business\, be responsible about it. It would be a very easy fix-just a screen on the bottom of the fence. The food was good but I won't be back."
"customer253.json","I recently had the pre fixe meal for $22 and I enjoyed the combination of tastes on my plate. The chicken was moist my veggies were tasty but a little too greasy....overall is was a great meal. \n\nI also use them for take out/delivery. I have always enjoyed the way the package their food\, in plastic containers that I use over and over again until they look too worn out and I recycle them. I hate take out places that use so much boxes and cups and card board - it's extremely eco-unfriendly. \n\nThe food here is never spectacular but is a good standby you will always come away enjoying. The prices seem a little steep but the restaurant atmosphere is contemporary\, the service has always been splendid and the food is dependable."
"customer254.json","It's no different than any other Chinese place. Same menu\, etc. this place does have some good lunch specials though\, and the food is always ready when I go to pick it up."
"customer255.json","Finally got to eat here last night. Eclectic foodie menu. I had their onion tart as an app and Kerry had the veal meatballs with sauce on polenta\, very delicious. The red gravy tasted like my own. We both ordered the special of citrus short ribs with fat noodles and brussel sprouts\, peas. couldn't finish we will be back to try other interesting items. Small crowded but great friendly atmosphere"
"customer256.json","Last night we tried to get into the oldest Italian Restaurant in South Philly. Thankfully\, they couldn't fit us in\, so our son said lets try Angelina's  so we walked around the corner and into a small Italian Restaurant.  Immediatly we felt at home.  Angelina is cooking in the front of the resaurant and her husband is servicing. There were 3 of us and we started off with Eggplant and roasted pepper appetizer.  One bite and we were hooked.  We ordered the Veal Osso Bocca\, Carbonara and lasagna.  Everything was absolutly DELISH!!  Can't wait to go back!!!"
"customer257.json","great food\, great view. Try the lobster mac and cheese"
"customer258.json","Super tasty and enormous portions. Some unique flavors too. Not much else to say but an amazing ice cream store that others should try to emulate."
"customer259.json","The food is average. Drink specials are great but the place is rarely crowded. Last time I was there it was a Friday night at 10 pm. There were maybe 3 other parties at the bar. About 5 minutes after ordering our first drink\, they announced it was last call...at 10:15 PM on a Friday night! Needless to say we left for a different bar in the area and have removed it from our options of places to go past 6 pm for drinks."
"customer260.json","A good place to order from when its late and you have the muchies... for whatever reason ;-)"
"customer261.json","You think Value City\, you think cheap value\, right? Wrong! \n\nThink Rothman prices with Ashley Furniture pieces. Not a Broyhill in sight. \n\nNegatives:\n- Entertainment centers and TV stand selection is small\, and over priced selection.\n-Their \"Clearance\" section is laughable and not much of a sale. No one is going to pay $299 for a nicked up coffee table that was originally $350. Go lower. \n- Sectionals by themselves average around $1\,000 by brands I've never heard of. \n- The staff hangs out like a clique chatting in the middle of the store rather than helping customers. \n-Dining sets are nothing special and overpriced as well. I've seen the same selection everywhere else at a lower price. \n-5% military discount? Ooooh you're going to knock $20 off my sofa! \n\nOnly Positive:\n-They have a few modern pieces. \n\nOverall:\n\nI think they're high for low quality-mediocre furniture. Shop around town. Or if you do find something you must have here\, wait for a holiday sale."
"customer262.json","I really like Franzone's. The owner is typically around\, super friendly\, and seems to really care about the product. While I'm not a big fan of sweet sauce\, they also do a decent cheesesteak\, fries\, etc. Honestly\, they may have been closer to a 4 if not that it's always just a really pleasant experience going in\, which boosts their rating for me."
"customer263.json","Finally had the chance to stop by Bab Cafe...what took us so long!  Both of us being Asian food fanatics\, we are so happy to have Bab Cafe part of our ever expanding culinary experience here in Reno.\n\nWith the guidance of the very friendly and knowledgeable staff\, we quickly got a hang of what to order\, though there will be many more choices on our future visits.  Liking things a little spicy\, we both ordered the Jeyuk Top-Bab (spicy pork).  What incredible flavor!  There is nothing that compares to this place in Reno.  The sauce bar gives you the opportunity to mix things up and the included miso soup is a definite bonus.  Great value for such a fresh\, enjoyable meal.  Convenient downtown location to take away\, dine in or have it delivered via UberEats."
"customer264.json","First meal in New Orleans. I had the $15 lunch special\, a seafood stew (with oyster meat\, crab claws\, shrimp\, and redfish) that came with a surprisingly thoughtful salad. Yeah\, it's weird: I'm not even a fan of seafood and\, to be honest\, I wasn't even really that hungry. Still\, before I knew what I was doing I had wolfed down the entire thing. The spice\, consistency\, tenderness of the meat -- all was precisely just right. Well worth your while."
"customer265.json","Totally worth the wait despite the heat!  I had the Vegan grits with a biscuit on the side. OMG!  So good. My 3 sisters each enjoyed their choices as well. Caution\, the bloody Mary's are spicy!  The service was excellent. Really considering the wait was 45 mins\, the line moved fast and then there was no long wait for our food. They have their process perfected!  Thanks Biscuit Love for a Delish breakfast!!!"
"customer266.json","Ichicoro Ane gets lots of things right and the best part about it is the combination of the ambiance with the food choices and whiskey selection. I'm very happy with this location and the servers I have encountered so far have been helpful and pleasant.\n\nThe katsu is great and I highly recommend it to people looking for a more filling dish on the menu. The bao buns were also good for a lighter fish. I haven't had anything I really regretted trying\, but definitely ask your server about the portion sizes of each dish since they vary across the menu.\n\nThe cocktail selection is excellent. I even had a special Japanese Old Fashioned last time which was a little expensive\, but well worth it for some quality Japanese whiskey. \n\nI'm looking forward to exploring the menu little by little. The best way to experience this is in a group setting so you can try more things and it really reminds me of Izakayas or Japanese pubs I visited in Japan and Korea."
"customer267.json","Love this bakery!! Great breakfast sandwiches\, coffee\, and donuts! My friend and I love coming on weekend mornings"
"customer268.json","There is a great selection of whiskey/bourbon to suit anyone's taste. We had burgers with the fried egg on it and it was soo good and probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. The duck fries are a MUST if you come here. It is a cute atmosphere although we went with a party of 4 and it was a tad awkward the way our seating was and made it difficult to have conversation with everyone at our table. Overall\, a nice place to go. We will be going back."
"customer269.json","A++ for ambience. Very cozy English pub feel. Great drinks too - the bartenders here know how to mix 'em. That being said\, the prices are steep (I paid $7 for a standard mixed drink) and the seating is limited."
"customer270.json","Very cozy place to have a drink with friends.  The drinks were tasty and were served in very pretty glasses reminiscent of those some of our grandmothers had in their china cabinets. On the downside\, all of the drinks seemed to have some combination of ginger\, lime\, and honey with the main difference being the kind of liquor you wanted in your drink.  So the choices felt limited.  I ordered the bacon wrapped dates\, and have to admit that I was choking them down because I was hungry.  They tasted like they were double dipped in sugar.  Also\, once another 10 or so people came in\, it was very hard to hear each other because the noise level skyrocketed\, which is surprising with so much fabric in the room.  The servers were nice and left us alone except to check on us every so often.  I don't recall being offered a second drink when my glass was taken away."
"customer271.json","This place always delivers. Yet another great year with hayrides\, pumpkin picking\, and lots of other activities."
"customer272.json","Called in to get service information on my 2015 $110K AMG. Was told since I didn't purchase the vehicle at their dealership that I would have to pay for a loaner car for warranty work. Will be staying far away from here."
"customer273.json","Like wholefoods but much smaller. They have all sorts of stuff from Salad bar\, to a small selection of fresh fruits\, juice bar. Great lil grocery store. Couldn't really find any other in the city. They have a parking lot. Great walking\, just a couple blocks from clothing stores"
"customer274.json","I absolutely love coming here. Great outdoor place with a wine selection you can't find anywhere else (not your typical wines you find in the grocery). The live music today was fabulous - and on a Thursday afternoon! Come here\, get a few cheeses and wine and you will be satisfied. Oh\, and the regular menu is crafty and artistic. It's a beautiful place with ambiance and on the palate."
"customer275.json","I love coming here to do my smog on my cars great service and chipper then most!!! I totally recommend this place."
"customer276.json","Outstanding! They have great gluten-free and vegan options too. The salad\, pizza\, and root beer were just perfect."
"customer277.json","My group of 6 all got burgers and were very satisfied. Very clean and nice place. Sweet potato tots are a must."
"customer278.json","out of ten -- ten being best\n\nfood: 7.8\n\nlighting: 10\n\nnoise: 10\n\nenvironment: 8.5\n\nstaff: 9"
"customer279.json","This is a convenience store deli\, so don't expect a neat restaurant setting or drink service (that's the only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5). I've had a Cuban press one time\, and a breakfast sandwich at another time. Sandwiches are prepared upon your order and I was very happy with the food. Delicious! There are some tables inside and some outside on the dock\, overlooking ocean. There is a more popular breakfast place (Maggie Mae's) in the same strip mall but taste-wise I must say I like this deli much better."
"customer280.json","My 2nd experience here was even better than the first.  I do believe there were some kinks during the grand opening.  This time around they seemed to have more than 1 beer bottle opener\, and the portion size of the garlic noodle did improve.  \nThe place still looked like it would get drafty at certain tables but we were seated at a better table this time around and I was not bothered by it.  Food was amazing as ever and I am looking forward to my next visit!\nWe had no problem getting seated on a sat evening at 5pm.  So glad to have these guys in the local neighborhood.  :D"
"customer281.json","I love Skyline Chili.  I first had this stuff in Cincinnati\, and I was thrilled to when a location opened in Clearwater. \n\nThis particular Skyline\, however\, is not great.  The service is generally poor\, and the food comes out very slowly.   It seems like every time that I go\, they are \"out\" of something\, or some equipment isn't working.  Sometimes it's baked potatoes\, sometimes it is french fries\, sometimes it is something else.\n\nLove the cheese coney hot dogs all the way!\n\nI hope this location can get their act together."
"customer282.json","So I no longer go here which is a shame because The eyebrow waxing here is fantastic. I am giving this 2 stars because when I have contacted for an appointment via the phone\, it usually has taken days for me to get a response. The online booking is useless because I rarely have found appointments within 2 weeks of when I need it (and I'm very flexible with time of day). \n\nI give up on this place. Unless you book out weeks in advance\, you will not get an appointment. I'm now paying $10 more elsewhere which sucks but I'm able to get seen when I need to be seen."
"customer283.json","great taco's\, nacho's\, atmosphere and margarita's.  wednesday is triple special day."
"customer284.json","I don't think they have enough staffs here. Always you can see customers waiting. It took them about an hour and more to have my car ready. Even worse\, in the next morning before I was gonna take my family out for a trip\, I found my car had no wiper fluid; hence I had no choice but went back and waste another hour waiting them to refill it.\n\nThe car was not thorough cleaned (either outside or inside). I rent the car on May 18th\, extremely close to my 25th birthday (June 6th)\, and still\, I was still charged for underage fee\, which is extremely expensive -- $20 BEFORE TAX PER DAY. There was just no way to waive it. I should have gone for\, and I will recommend others in the future to find another rental company such as Hertz\, at which you can always find codes to waive this crazy fee.\n\nThe last thing is DO NOT buy the fuel option. Although it claims $1.99 per gallon\, this is before tax. You will find the price after tax to be very closed to what you can find outside. And\, you will NEVER return the car on empty. This is nothing good but a trick for rental companies to steal 3- to 4-gallon sales from you.\n\n\n*** Final note:\nNot about this location but where I returned my car.\n\n\"Return Location Address and Phone Number :\nPORT JEFFERSON STATION\n320 ROUTE 112\nPORT JEFFERSON STATION\, NY 11776-1010\nTel.: (631) 474-2100\"\n\nThis address is totally WRONG!!! I kept asking people around this address for the right location and wasted another hour when returning my car!"
"customer285.json","Thanks yelp reviewers...you didn't let me down!  And neither did Todd and Roberta!  They just left my house and I am in awe of what an amazing job they did!  Carpet and couch looks great...spots where my dog a some accidents the other day are all gone! Everything just smells fresh...no chemicals to inhale and nothing has that \"wet\" smell.  And I can't believe how dry it all is so soon after!  Plus they are the\nNICEST people with tons of knowledge and tips on how to care for your home.  Worth every penny and not only recommending them but definitely will be using them in the future!!!"
"customer286.json","Love it here! Their sips mocha is my go-to. Staff has always been so nice! Absolutely love that they have a drive thru too\, helps not to unload my kiddos. Oh and their cakes are amazing too!"
"customer287.json","I have been a fan of Chateau La Vin for a few years. It has been fun to watch the place evolve. At first it was more of a wine store with only a few tables. Now it has been transformed into a wine bar. He offers cheese and crackers and people order from the local restaurants and some of them even deliver. He had two guys playing music. He offers so many different wines and is willing to share his knowledge. My friend is a beer drinker and he has a nice variety for them as well. He does have a few tables out in front. This is a great place....."
"customer288.json","We used The Hollander Hotel for our wedding hotel and it was an absolutely incredible experience.  I will never get tired of raving about our experience.  We were honored to use the Hollander not only for our room block and wedding night suite\, but we also used the Tap Room as our after-party location and we hosted a brunch for our guests on the beautiful patio on Sunday morning after the wedding.  Everything was perfection and if we could do it all over again\, we wouldn't change a thing!\n\nThe hotel property is absolutely charming.  The décor in the lobby is beautiful\, eclectic\, and very welcoming.  The Tap Room is a great place for people to gather with intimate booths and large tables for bigger parties.  The Bar has an amazing selection of local and craft beers and the servers and bartenders are all professional and fast! We were able to use the Lobby and Tap Room for some of our wedding photographs too\, and they all look wonderful!\n\nThe rooms are very pleasant and quaint and our guests all complimented on how clean and cozy they were.  The prices were also wonderful and our guests were able to enjoy downtown St. Pete because of the great location.  The shuttle is also very convenient and a great experience for guests!\n\nThe brunch was perfect.  Not only was the price great for an all-you-can-enjoy feast\, but the food is delicious and homemade.  The wonderful gentleman who makes the omelets is friendly\, fast\, and takes great pride in his work.  He is also a talented baker and I couldn't get enough of the chocolate muffins he made!  The service at the new coffee/dessert café was wonderful!  The Patio was a great place to visit with our guests and enjoy the beautiful St. Pete weather. We look forward to many more brunches there in the future! \n\nFinally\, the best part of all is the management and team at the Hollander.  Nick and Will treated us like their own family.  They went above and beyond to ensure that each of our guests felt like they were at home and comfortable.  Zach at the front desk was so friendly and patient with me as I called checking on our room block.  The entire team was just a delight and so very accommodating.  They take great pride in ensuring that every guest has a wonderful experience.  We just adore everyone there!  I absolutely loved working with them and would recommend this beautiful hotel to anyone!"
"customer289.json","I got the gyro \"platter\" for lunch\, which was dry\, uninspired\, and nothing like a deconstructed gyro. Worst of all\, it came with \"vegetables\" which looked more like poop. Tasted that way\, too. There are better places in Fairmount for lunch\, and they won't serve you poop\, either."
"customer290.json","I went there for drinks and found the environment really nice with the brewery right there. The beer was good and the waiter was very knowledgable and kind"
"customer291.json","OMG! What an amazing dinner experience. A friend recommended this place and it was incredible. We had two of their signature dishes -- the BBQ shrimp and bread pudding. This is a fantastic restaurant with great ambience and fantastic service. Highly recommend it if you're visiting New Orleans. Their fried green tomato appetizer was a great way to kick off the meal."
"customer292.json","Great store. Insane selection. Incredible customer service.\n\nWish they could come to Ft. McMurray. \n\n:("
"customer293.json","LYING SCAMMERS. BAIT AND SWITCH. Will try and take advantage of you! Online coupon says 15$ for unlimited tanning any bed for a week for first time customers. Went to Chippewa location\, The lady behind the desk acted like she had no idea what I was talking about. Then I pulled up the coupon and she said it's only for students and that I needed a student ID. However the coupon said nothing about this. Then she switched to saying the coupon is expired\, yet it's still on YELP and they're website. She also said they won't honor the $75 for 45$ coupon you can literally purchase on yelp either. Just bullshit line after bullshit line. I then left And called creve coeur location and the lady there says\, \"yes you can still use that coupon\, but you must go to the same location each time for that week once you choose a location.\" I knew this as my girlfriend used it last week. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!!!!"
"customer294.json","Very impressed with this place! The food was amazing. Quick service chipotle style line ordering but with high-quality Indian food. Also the staff was super helpful in helping me decide what to get since I'm an Indian food newbie. Can't wait to eat there again!"
"customer295.json","Although there are countless little Mexican places below Washington Avenue\, I never get sick of them and always look forward to trying the new kid on the block. This time it was El Sabor Poblano on Federal\, which could not look less special if it tried.\n\nI liked that there were 3 fish tacos on the menu.  I picked the fried and battered version\, though the tortilla chip covered fish could have been awesome. I was instantly impressed when I opened one of my three and found that El Sabor puts an entire filet of fish in each taco! The flakey meat had no fishy taste. These tacos came with the more American toppings of lettuce and\, tomato\, and cheese. I bet I could have gotten cilantro and onion if I asked. The sole staff member in the place seemed happy to accommodate us- well\, we were the only ones dining in.\n\nAnother taco filling option that comes with more traditional toppings is the super crispy chorizo\, only $8 for 3. There was no detectable gristle here\, something I have often come across at this little places.\n\nAs unassuming as it looks\, this particular South Philly Mexican place is worth stopping by."
"customer296.json","I met a buddy mine at this spot that I have always wanted to go to\, but have never had the time. I walked in and sat at the bar. The police were investigating a burglary from the overnight it seemed some dirt bags broke in on a side door and stole a bunch of liquor from the bar. The bartender was great and service was prompt. I ordered a pint  of dark ale and my buddy and I split a order of wings. The beer was cold and the wings were very tasty. I remembered meeting the owners of the establishment at the last Italian Fest at the Farmers Market so I really wanted to like this place as they were very friendly folks. I will continue to patronize this spot as it was a great spot close to home and work. I also like the locally non franchised making it work attitude that this place gives. I really was very comfortable at this establishment and well tell the rest of fellow Yelpers to hit this spot!!!"
"customer297.json","Found this place on Yelp. The reviews speak for themselves and are so true. The sandwiches are really tasty. Definitely worth the wait in line. Fast and friendly service. We waited about 15 minutes in line\, ordered 4 different sandwiches\, filled up our sodas\, walked out to our table\, and our sandwiches were delivered to us as we say down. We enjoyed our meal."
"customer298.json","By far some of the most comfy theater recliners. My only complaint is that you have to put your feet down if someone wants to pass by you on the aisle. The bartender at the little lounge next to the theaters is a delight. And being able to drink in the theater is a nice plus. The drawback comes with concessions. At a peak time on a Saturday\, there were 5-6 employees at the counter but utter disorganization and no hustle whatsoever. The popcorn was also burnt. Next time I'll eat beforehand and stick with the bar."
"customer299.json","This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at.  Clean\, polite staff\, nice pool and grand entrance.   I can't wait until next year to come back."
"customer300.json","I went here when if first opened\, and have never desired to go back again\, I was so very disappointed at the quality and the taste of the food. I would absolutely not recommend dining here."
"customer301.json","Went on a Sunday afternoon and there were only a handful of people there.  We sat at the bar and were greeted by a bartender who started by telling us they were out of most food items.  No worries\, we just wanted a couple of beers.  We sampled several varieties\, all of which were average.  Nothing memorable about any of the six styles we tried.\n\nUnfortunately\,  the staff was in a snit because their relief was late.  I get it\, but they were having a full blown discussion behind the bar which all patrons could hear.  Kind of put a damper on things.\n\nCool location and cool place\, but not sure we would go back based on this visit as there are better options near by."
"customer302.json","Hate to be harsh but dang! After having a limited selection at terminal F I finally decided to go with Tony Luke's. I was looking forward in trying there Philly Cheese Steak been in Philly and all. So I unraveled the sandwich and to no surprise the sandwich I got didn't look nothing like the picture on the overhead display of the sandwich. The part that got me even more was the meat. I don't know what it taste like to eat dog food\, but I am sure I just paid $10 for it."
"customer303.json","Love this place.   Best kept secret in Creve Couer.   9 hole course - affordable\nStaff is helpful"
"customer304.json","It's my first time here and the service is slow. The employees don't have good attitude but the food it's good."
"customer305.json","I was here a few times before and didn't review. I come here for the food\, NOT the service. The establishment is lacking in its service. Their food is always great though! Very delicious for a dive bar."
"customer306.json","I've been to many art museums and was surprised to see a museum this beautiful with such a great collection to be FREE! I was so happy to have had discovered this museum in my short time in Indianapolis. I loved the African Art and the Modern Art sections (although I did make a mistake taking out my camera for the Modern Art museums.. that's a no no). The outdoor sculpture garden and gift shop was awesome as well. Highly recommended!"
"customer307.json","You would think from the size of the place it would be good for groups\, but in my experience with 9 people on Saturday at 11am it was about a very hungry\, tiring wait to get a seat. \n\nWe tried to make reservations\, but they do not take them. And I think we were too small to be put in the side meeting room. So hangry we stood\, hoping for just the right table to leave.\n\nThe manager was nice enough to offer to fill cups of coffee for us while we waited. But I thought it was odd that they just didn't refill the pot for everyone who was waiting. \n\nNow for the food...They have these 1/2 and 1/2 combos. Which I love! I got a turkey Reuben and salad. I asked for lots of sauerkraut\, and they charged $0.50 for it.. Which is no biggie but I'd expect a lot of kraut. Sadly there was not a lot of it.. But it was still a delicious sandwhich.  :) My friend got the sunrise chile rellenos. If I come back with a smaller party\, that is what I would get."
"customer308.json","The Shop is an amazing space! Their attention to detail and services are unbelievable. Plenty of places to have private meetings as well as post up and get work done."
"customer309.json","My husband took me here for our Anniversary and it was such a delight! Hats off to the chef for the amazing dinner that melted in my mouth. And the customer service was top notch. Definitely will be back!"
"customer310.json","Terrace Lounge appears to want to have a great cocktail venue\, but they fall short.  One bartender didn't even know there was a new cocktail menu.  The cocktail was weak and watery\, and the liquors they have here and throughout Peppermill are the most unfortunate corporate types.  The service is also very spotty.  It confounded me how four bartenders could not seem to handle about 45 customers.  They didn't have any bar areas\, so they all floated around the circle\, but then they'd stop\, often just short of me and go to the waitress stations to fill their orders.  You can't really build up any rapport with four bartenders floating around trying to serve everyone.  I also hated the people there.  Sorry\, but many were your run-of-the-mill casino gamblers.  Why don't you just sit at a machine and play?  You didn't come here for the drinks or to smooze with the bartenders\, so seriously\, go sit at a machine.  One just sat next to me and lite up a cancer stick and the smoke just blew in my face.  Look\, if I walk into a bar and sit next to someone\, it's their turf.  They can smoke\, fart\, vomit on themselves\, if I don't like it I can leave.  But if I'm there\, it's my turf.  Don't come sit next to me and smoke\, fart\, or vomit all over yourself.  Or at least be frickin thoughtful and if you see your smoke wafting in my face\, put your cancer stick and tray on the other side of the bar so it wafts in your face.  Oh\, you don't like smoke in your face???  Me neither moron.  Your life revovles around throwing away your pension money in a mindless electronic game of cards and killing yourself with carcinogens and toxins\, well go kill yourself in private\, seriously.  You don't see me walking up to a bar and slitting my wrists and burning my money.  It's gross.  I probably just realized this\, but I really enjoy Cin Cin not only because they have the best cocktails in town\, but they have no machines at the bar.  Peppermill\, if you want to create a cool cocktail bar\, ditch the machines\, train your staff\, or hire bartenders with better service skills\, and buy some independent liquors."
"customer311.json","Awesome service (ask for Amanda\, resident comedian); very friendly staff.  Food was really good and beer was cold."
"customer312.json","This is my favorite nail shop in the city I've been going here for years....I enjoy the quiet serene atmosphere...the staff is very friendly and efficient....the price of $25.00 for a pedicure in the South....you can't beat it!"
"customer313.json","Thank you for a lovely morning!  I was in NJ early and decided to stop in for a delicious diner breakfast.  I got a taylor ham\, egg\, and cheese and a short stack of blueberry pancakes (I simply couldn't decide between sweet or savory\, plus leftovers are never a bad thing).  \n\nThe egg sandwich was fantastic.  I was nervous when they said they didn't have kaiser rolls so I went with a hamburger roll.  It was an excellent decision.  The roll was excellent - not just an average cheap hamburger roll.  They layered the cheese on the sandwich\, which to me is a must for a true egg sandwich.  It was served with home fries\, which were sauteed with large slices of peppers and onions.  I'm not the biggest breakfast potatoes fan\, but these were great and I appreciated that they didn't clearly just scoop some food from a huge pile of pre-cooked home fries.\n\nThe pancakes were great and fluffy.  My one gripe was their use of smuckers pre-packaged syrup.  I realize that if they put syrup in a container\, it probably wouldn't be real maple syrup\, but I sort of wish I didn't know that they were giving me sub-par syrup.\n\nThe server was friendly and very attentive.  The coffee refills were constant\, and the coffee was actually good (so many diners fail at coffee).  Bonus points for the server agreeing not to judge my decision to get two breakfasts.\n\nAll around\, I loved this place and hope to go back soon.  Long live the Jersey diners!"
"customer314.json","Our server was awesome. Very tentative and extremely nice! That is the only thing saving this place plus the maple wings were delicious. Now for the bad part. We paid 35 dollars for the \"piano guys\" to sing a song to the birthday girl. We had 3 options of songs that we wanted to hear. They called our birthday girl on stage and began to sing a rendition of Aladins whole new world. (Which was not one of the songs we had picked) The song quickly turned to a absolutely disgusting remake. The piano guy sang so our birthday girl about opening her thighs\,tying her up\, filling holes\, splurging on her face\, and cumming in her hair. It was even worse than that. Her husband and family including parents were in the crowd but luckily couldn't hear to well because the sound system is terrible. Our birthday girl even stopped the piano man and told him to stop and he continued and made it even dirtier. It was disgusting\, offensive\, and embarrassing. Trust me we are not prudes by any means but this was way too far. It completely ruined the experience and we all immediately left. We spent our time and money there only to have the birthday ruined. Also for 35 dollars we paid we only heard 1 of the songs which they only sang  part of."
"customer315.json","The new Han Dynasty took over the spot where the old Mid-Atlantic restaurant (with the unchanging menu) was. I like the Han Dynasty here a lot more than the one in Olde City even if I give both 4*. Maybe I'm biased\, because I love the service here. They've always been very nice\, and came over to check in with me and just make some small conversation when they heard I had a peanut allergy (even though they had no peanuts in any of the dishes I ordered; I think it was Han's sister?). I've been to this Han Dynasty more times in a month than the number of times I've been to the other.\n\nNote though\, that the different branches have different specialties. I heard the dan dan mian in Olde City is the best\, but the one in UC isn't so good (I wouldn't know since it has peanuts). Overall\, I think it;s okay food wise\, still not spicy enough as with the other branch. But I like the layout and atmosphere a lot more.\n\nNext\, if you go during lunch\, you can ask for lunch portions\, that are smaller than the dinner portions\, and half the menu price! So it's a great lunch place too\, alone\, or in a group of 2 or 3."
"customer316.json","We went to Carisma Restaurante again tonight. It has become our \"go to\" spot. The food is excellent and the service was great. The owner Jose is very friendly and tries to visit every table to make sure everyone is satisfied.  Tonight we had 2 Paellas\, salmon and a filet mignon. Everything was made to order\, cooked to perfection and came out hot.  \n\nThe family also opened a cafe in front of the restaurant. Jose gave us a tour and introduced us to his daughter that runs the cafe. The baked goods and coffees at the cafe are just as good as the meals at Carisma. Good\, fresh food prepared and served by nice people. Try Carisma\, it's so much more than just the normal tacos and burritos. You wont be disappointed!"
"customer317.json","This is a small hole in the wall in the African section of Woodland Avenue.  Though it might not look like much\, there is some good food coming out of its kitchen representing Senegal and West Africa.  I enjoyed the national dish of Senegal - Thiboudienne - although note that here they do a version without the usual tomato sauce.  I also took home a Jollof Rice which is often called the mother dish of Jambalaya.  There are a few hightop tables inside for dining or you can order the food to-go.  Either way\, service is friendly."
"customer318.json","Had a falafel wrap here a few years ago. Not bad\, so tried it again today. No flavor\, except extreme saltiness! The falafels & pita = no flavor. I was hoping the tzatziki sauce would pull it all together\, nope! It had no flavor either. It wasn't like the sauce you'd imagine\, but more like a thin tasteless glue. Only good part about the wrap were the fresh diced cucumber & tomato\, too bad that was underneath the icky white sauce that doesn't even deserve to be called tzatziki : ("
"customer319.json","Exactly as bougie and casual at the same time as you need it to be. Come with your Gucci bag or in your yoga pants and slam a delicious cocktail or three."
"customer320.json","Our group of 6 decided to try something different.  So\,  we gave this place a shot.   Very happy with our decision. \n\nThe wife and I shared the special\,  which was a massive amount of food for the two of us.   It was a great sampling of all their food options. \n\nThe chicken\, steak and rice/beans were pretty amazing.  I could do without the egg\,  but it was easy enough to push over to the side.   I'm not a fan of Yuca\, but this wasn't bad.   The plantains were delicious.   I didn't try the salad... Just wasn't in the mood for it. \n\nAll in all\,  the place is a must visit if you are up for trying something new."
"customer321.json","Out lunch today was pulled pork\, smokehouse bowl\, and delicious sides of sweet potato casserole and red beans and rice.   Red beans and rice was spicy but good. Sweet potato casserole yummy and meat was smoky juicy and plentiful. Definitely a must."
"customer322.json","Awesome detailing job. My car was DIRTY. Hadn't washed it in months. Got the executive detailing option now look at me."
"customer323.json","We belong to lifetime in another state and were visitingvisiting from Colorado to buy a potential second-home in the area. First Jen The front desk person was so nice and very helpful.   She speaks so highly of the club and all of the amenities that it offers.    I also met Joe the general manager what a terrific guy.     The club is much smaller than other lifetimes however very full service for those who want The next level and service.    The bathrooms are fantastic and for the men fully stocked with shavers\, shaving cream and lotions.   You need absolutely no toiletries all provided.  Great location next to the mall.  Highly recommend."
"customer324.json","Tried the pulled pork\, green beans\, Mac n cheese and cornbread. It was all pretty mediocre barbecue. Not bad\, not great. The pork was a little overdone/dry\, but had a nice smoky flavor. The original bbq sauce is pretty sweet/syrupy. Ill probably go back\, but I wouldn't if there was a better option as close to my house."
"customer325.json","Husband and I made a mistake and came here on a Lenten Friday. The wait was forever. But since we were already there\, might as well suck it up and see what's it all about. We ordered the blackened alligator and oysters for appetizers\, the alligator came out within 15 minutes\, and it was alright. A bit too greasy. Then another 15 minutes later\, our raw oysters came out\, I wanted mine char grilled but the waitress didn't mention they don't have char grilled oysters and still took my order\, so I thought I was waiting for mine to be cooked the entire time. When she brought out the two half-dozen raw oyster trays\, that's when she told me they only have raw oysters there. SMH. I have sensitive stomach so I only had 3 then gave the rest to my husband. Regardless\, the oysters were really fresh. We waited for at least another 20 minutes later for our entrees to come out. At this point\, I was really hungry and had hoped we were at home eating ramen noodles instead. My husband had the roast beef po-boy\, and I had the tuna and shrimp kabob. My husband told me his roast beef was really salty and while ironically\, my kabob was very bland. The kabob came with exactly 3 pieces of cubed tuna\, 2 medium size shrimp with plenty of bell peppers and onions in between\, and baby shrimp creole with rice. For the ok price\, I shouldn't complain too much about this place. Didn't try their seafood boil\, but it looked like that would have been a better choice."
"customer326.json","im going to have to give this place one star for its horrible customer service:\n\ni called in to ask about the 50% off for tulane students they were advertising\, the woman assured me if i came with an id it would be half off and made an appointment for me\, only once i got there did they tell me it's only on certain days\, \"it says it right on the sign\,\" i was perturbed by the inconvenience and said so you're not going to honor it even though you just made an appointment with me and told me it would be 50% off\, they said no flat out at first even though the error was blatantly on their side\, after my nagging\, she eventually called john jay himself and he told the woman that he would not honor what i was told even though i had been inconvenienced by someone in HIS staff because it might cause a 'domino effect\,' i said how will there be a domino effect unless you continue to give people incorrect information\, there will be no other 'dominoes' as long as you remember what day it is from now on... they began to treat me somewhat patronizingly as i explained that usually businesses make concessions when they are the one at fault\, that the customer is supposed to always be right\, yadda yadda yadda\, i left pretty upset and with ~45 minutes of my life having been wasted - empty handed but for a lame excuse from someone who owns at least 3 businesses over 10 dollars...\n\ni have not received a haircut from them so if you're one of those people who ONLY cares about the product and you think you'll get a good cut go right on ahead\, but if you're like me (principled) and you don't like handing profits to people who care nothing about their customers this is a good place to skip next time you need a cut"
"customer327.json","Awesome food\, great place to split a bunch of delicious spicy\, ultra flavorful dishes with a large group. It's the Chinese restaurant a lot of people know about for good reason - I haven't had a single bad dish here\, and it's always a crowd-pleaser."
"customer328.json","My friend and I visited Tampa for a concert\, and about ten minutes away from the Atlanta airport he realized that he had purchased tickets for the wrong day. We had already made hotel reservations and bought the concert tickets\, so he just had to pay same-day price for airfare: all in all about $800 more. \"It was totally worth it\,\" he later told me\, \"Because I got to have the best sandwich of my entire life.\"\n\nAll because we randomly picked the Bricks of Ybor from Yelp. I can't vouch for the peanut butter or meatless menu\, but the meat sandwiches that we bought were absolutely phenomenal. I had the pulled pork\, which was flavored with ponzu and served on Hawaiian sweet bread. It was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. We spent a few hours hanging out and drinking\, during which time Brian\, the owner\, came out and talked to us\, comped us a drink\, let us try new appetizers he was developing (all for free) and generally made us feel really welcome. \n\nI kept my eyes open to the kind of crowd that came in and out of the restaurant. It seemed to draw everything from hipsters to geriatrics and strait-laced families with young kids. I think it speaks to both the diversity of the menu and the pleasant environment. We went back for drinks before and after the concert. It got very crowded but we still received excellent food\, drinks and service. I give this restaurant my strongest recommendation\, and it's the first place I'm going when I next visit Tampa."
"customer329.json","So worth the wait! The crepes are amazing! I also loved the grits\, which is rare. Tried my hubby's pancakes....awesome!"
"customer330.json","My sister-in-law and I visited this restaurant on 8/28/15 mid afternoon.  We were seated after requested 3 times that the hostess speak a little louder because we couldn't even hear her with the background music.  We were seated in a booth with a never ending Larry King vitamin commercial on the TV - really?  Our waitress introduced herself and a new trainee and then we never saw her again.  Two other wait staff seemed to be sharing our table\, but no idea who was responsible for our table.  We got our drinks and ordered\, but food took forever considering there was not more than 15-20 filled tables in the entire restaurant.  Burgers were not bad - I ordered the blue cheese burger and it would have been better with less blue cheese\, way too much!  Fries and onion sticks were very good.  But no one came to see if we were satisfied\, needing anything\, etc and took two requests and waiting to get a carry out box.  There was a family seated across the aisle from us when we arrived and we assumed they had finished their meal and were \"hanging out\".  Only after we received our food did we understand they had already ordered and still did not have their food!  I doubt I will return to this restaurant in the future."
"customer331.json","In short\, the food was decently good\, but completely overpriced.  The guacamole and my Mojito were probably the highlight of the meal. I had the peach pork medallions\, which were nicely cooked\, but lacked flavor. I tried the corn cakes with Barbacoa and that was pretty good.  \n\nThe atmosphere was inviting with a hip feel if that's what you're looking for.  What was really annoying was the parking situation. For a place with price points such as these and limited parking spaces\, a valet service should be provided either at a cost or complimentary.  Don't even try and park in the back of the building\, it's tight and dangerous even getting there and back.  I ended up parking three blocks away and broke a sweat walking in the dead of summer to the front entrance."
"customer332.json","Had dinner Saturday night for the first time at rusty pelican. Called ahead and made a reservation and requested a table next to the window overlooking the water. Hostess went to seat us away from the window\, when we questioned her she huffed off and left us staying in the middle of the dining room!! She did return and sat us by the window. The rest of the evening was great\, drinks\, food and wait staff was excellent. Liz was our server and went above and beyond. Still have to say the hostess was very disappointing!"
"customer333.json","This was a tough one!   On the merits of the wine\, fairly average... I understand that the winery has more than one lable and other label is their premium wines.  I look forward to when that is available (I went two weeks ago so maybe it already is)     Location..   what's not to like?  On the pier!  A wonderful outdoor patio\,  couldn't have a nicer setting to enjoy your tasting....   The staff were super\, super nice\,  I would give them an A+!  \n\nSo why only three stars?  It is because of the wine club!  Very expensive for the quality of the wines and stingy as HELL with the benefits to the members..   Most wine clubs will give you a free tasting every time you come in (after all\, we are your best customers... we are the ones who buy your wine time and time again).  Some wineries will give their members a complimentary glass in leau of a tasting (Carr).   Most wineries allow you to bring guests which is how you get new wine club members.   This system works folks!  The way this wine club works is that you are given a very limited number of passes per quarter\, five as I recall.   If I come with my wife once a month we wouldn't even be covered... let alone if we bring a guest!   \n\nSo go to this winery if you want to enjoy a tasting in one of the most beautiful settings on earth.   But avoid the wine club!  For that you can pretty much go to any of the other wine tasting rooms on the Urban wine trail."
"customer334.json","I got a cheap haircut in NY for next to nothing and what do you know. it looks like some crazy chimp chewed up my hair and spat  it back on my raw scalp.\n\nSince I'm going for job interviews\, I needed to look better and went to Domenick's. The guys were great\, Robert cut my hair and did a clean job. Bill came out to $35. I'd give it a 4\, but it was a little pricy for my taste\, but I look human again. Don't know what you guys in Philly normally pay for a haircut."
"customer335.json","Very unhappy\, you lost a valued customer. We had a problem where Monro Muffler underfilled our engine by 3 quarts of oil and caused damage to the engine. Monro's insurance company said they would pay for damages if we brought to the dealer\, we were frequent customers of Bergeys so we brought it here. They discovered the timing chain needed to be replaced\, a chain that lasts the life of the car unless you don't change the oil or have low oil pressure the tensioner can lock and stretch the chain. Joe the service associate that took the car in specifically said I told the insurance company as little as possible and told them he couldn't tell if it was from the oil and there was no way to tell. And on top of that\, was extremely rude and unprofessional to my wife bringing her to tears the way he spoke to her. My wife and I just bought a house in the area\, only 26 years old and you lost a life long customer. Over the past year we spent about $7000 in repairs here\, and Joe went out of his way to be unhelpful and leave us in a terrible spot. I brought it to another mechanic who was able to help us prove more it was from the oil and do what Joe told us and the insurance company they could not do. So on top of losing a service customer\, I'm on the market for a new car and can tell you for sure where I will not be getting it."
"customer336.json","Beautiful clean shop with knock your socks off Everything ...\nHomemade breakfast tarts and chicken pot pies .\nAll sweets looked well beyond beautiful and delish.\nI felt some of the items were a tad pricey considering the sizes being on a smaller size. But I know premium quality costs more .. \nIt's a great place for locals and worth a trip if traveling from center city etc .\nI found counter staff to be most friendly and engaging \nWill be back and certainly will recommend"
"customer337.json","Definitely get in line before 8:30am. We waited about 30 minutes. Pancakes were fine. My friends got the raspberry pancakes\, the sweet potato pancakes and the san antonio. I got the sugar and spice pancakes. All were well and fine\, a bit dry. I don't understand the hype\, but if the line isn't too long it's not bad for normal breakfast food. If the line is longer I would highly recommend skipping this place and heading down the street to Fido - insanely good coffee and great breakfast food."
"customer338.json","They have the WORST service advisors! Used to be good before Kelly and her team left. Unfortunately\, it's convenient to work if I need oil change before I can make it to another Honda dealer."
"customer339.json","The best soon-dubu in the city!  This place is tucked away and once you walk in\, it's like you've stepped into a Korean home.  Very welcoming\, warm and inviting.\n\nIt's very vegetarian friendly!  The soft tofu is stewed and put into the dol sot pots which each and every stew feels like it's custom made for you. \n\nYou can select from beef\, seafood or mixed meats (seafood & beef)\, mushroom\, and just plain.  They can adjust the spice as needed too.  I always get the extra hot with the hot temperature\, can't beat it.  The rice also comes in a dol-sot which is great if you leave it in for a while\, it burns the rice into a nice crispy shell.  DROOL.\n\nJust thinking about this place makes my mouth salivate!  \n\nIf you're not into tofu\, they also offer korean bbq meats (cooked in the back)\, with other soup/stew items.\n\nLove this place!!!"
"customer340.json","As motels go this one is very nice for the rate. Clean\, comfortable and well-managed. You get what you pay for so the breakfast buffet is just OK. The pool is too small to swim laps (disappointing). The lobby area is spacious and comportable. \n\nIf you are looking for a moderately priced place to sleep that is clean and comforable this will suit you just fine."
"customer341.json","The only reason I mentioned the media or attorney was out of frustration after he would not provide the owner's contact info so I could appeal to her about keeping the area clean and cleaning or painting the columbarium.  That older area that is out of sight has been that way for years but we finally got tired of it and complained.  He never admitted it could be cleaned up.  As for the vase\, I didn't demand just one for my Dad.  I stated he should replace the cheap plastic vases on ALL the niches as they were falling off and disintegrating.  There are not very many of them. I simply thought it would be the right thing to do.  \n\nIf there was empathy\, I did not hear it."
"customer342.json","From the second you walk in the door\, you're greeted by the adorable woman at the counter. It seems if you come in here more than once a week\, she'll know you're name but I haven't been so lucky since my visits are a bit more sporadic.\n\nMy most recent discovery are the vegetarian breakfast sandwiches\, which are served all day! I particularly enjoy veg. sausage w/ havarti on an everything bagel. I could actually go for one right about now... I've also had the veggie club sandwich and my other half has enjoyed the chicken cheesesteak hoagie and the chicken salad on a croissant. Everything always taste fresh\, they are priced really well  (I think my favorite bagel sandwich I mentioned is $2.09-2.99- cheaper than wawa!). The people at the deli are super helpful\, offering menus if you can't read the one on the wall and will make great suggestions and accommodations to your needs and want.\n\nDon't forget to grab a really great snack too while you're there- they have amazing chocolate bars\, an incredible drink case\, tons of chip varieties and those addictive hi-chew candies in every flavor.\n\nI know i'll be back here\, who doesn't like fast / delicious / attentive service?"
"customer343.json","We stopped in for brunch and we weren't expecting the food to be so delicious.  The 3 meat hash was amazing\, as was the turkey sandwich and bagel/salmon.  The employees were very friendly and accommodating.  A little pricey\, but well worth.  We will visit again if in the area."
"customer344.json","Nice little bar located at the very far end of Terminal E and Tampa International. The airport recently added several new restaurants with a \"local vibe\" and this is one of them. There isn't a ton of seating but it also isn't close to the TSA area so it's a bit hidden. Hey have TVs if you wanna catch a game while you wait for your flight. Food is very reasonably price for the portion size. Appetizers run from $5-$10 and majority of sandwiches are $12. I didn't order any food but it looked amazing! Drinks are tasty and Prices are not terrible. Think 22oz Jai Alai for $8.50. You cannot take alcoholic beverages into the terminal (Columbia does this I think). I had a Manhattan for $11 and it was very tasty. Staff is attentive and friendly. I know my new spot when I'm waiting on a Delta flight!"
"customer345.json","The depot burger is so delicious along with the shishito peppers! Perfect food\, perfect atmosphere\, perfect drinks!"
"customer346.json","Quality of this store has gone downhill over the past few years. In the past\,  I was able to easily choose from a wide selection of food at reasonable prices any time of day. I have noticed recently that the produce is not as fresh\, but more expensive\,  and the prices of the organic foods are more expensive than Whole Foods. This morning I debated on going to Wegmans or going to this store. I only had to get a few items so I decided on this Giant since it was closer. Big mistake. I have seen on average at least 3 or 4 people shopping around 5 a.m. In the past but today just me. They had all of the store roped off where it was impossible to get to certain aisles and very difficult to get to the register. In my frustration I went under a rope to get soup.  I was then berated by a number of people who were supposed to be cleaning the floors but some were just standing around doing nothing. I couldn't even walk out of the closest door because that was blocked off. If they needed to clean the floor they should have closed the store for a few hours. It would have taken less time at Wegmans which is where I will shop for now on."
"customer347.json","This place is a hidden gem.  It is located in a strip mall\, but this restaurant is anything but a strip mall restaurant.   My husband took me here for my birthday and I was blown away with the whole experience.  It's a very modern\, romantic atmosphere.  The food is excellent.  I was shocked by the Fois gras-amazing.  I had the prix fixe menu and I loved ordering 3 courses.  The short ribs were great\, but I want to try something new next time.  The desserts were awesome.  I usually take caramel\, but there was a caramel tart that was to die for.  Can't wait to go back!!!!"
"customer348.json","--------DINNER REVIEW----------\n\nI rarely write reviews\, but this honestly was one of the worst group dining experiences I've ever had. It was objectively a horrible experience\, even without comparing it to the hype it receives\, and ruined what was supposed to be a nice birthday dinner celebration. \n\nWe had a group of 8 that had a reservation made well in advance. Short wait\, but not too bad. Keep in mind\, it seemed like a normal Friday night\, but weren't super busy or at-capacity.\n\nIt was a birthday dinner\, so I told the hostesses that it was her birthday\, and asked if they could bring out something for her at the end of the meal\, which was acknowledged. Pretty standard stuff\, whether at a Applebee's or the French Laundry. We were sat at a booth right next to the Maitre D' stand\, and next to all the wait staff's home base\, so pretty much no excuse for not getting any attention. \n\nAfter getting us waters\, it took them a LONG time to even come by and acknowledge us. After ordering wine\, it took them another good 15-20 minutes to even bring us our wine\, and no one even checked in on us! (hint: if you're running a restaurant\, wine is your profit center and doesn't take any work other than taking a bottle off a shelf and opening it. bring it out ASAP...). \n\nAfter ordering food\, it was more of the same...a long wait for food to start coming out and no one checking in on us AT ALL. We drank the bottles we ordered and had to get up and flag someone down to get another wine order. A couple of us even got up during the meal to remind them to bring out something for birthday girl at the end of the meal. \n\nOnce our meal was done and taken away\, we were given dessert menus and the server disappeared for 10-15 minutes... AGAIN. After coming back\, he asked what dessert we wanted\, so we ordered some coffees... and waited... and waited. Eventually we got up and asked him what was going on and if they were going to bring anything out like we asked multiple times. \n\nThey finally brought out a couple of cookies with a candle...\n\nIn summary\, the food was pretty hit or miss\, pretty mediocre for this price point. Whipped feta\, like other reviews have said\, was amazing\, and the Braised Lamb was really good. But the Sirloin was chewy and bland and the Grilled Caesar tasted like a soggy\, luke-warm\, wilted mess (two orders were left untouched by a group of 8). Atmosphere was nice and trendy. But the service\, which is a huge reason to spend your hard-earned $ at a restaurant\, was absolutely horrendous. \n\nI really love going to cool\, popular restaurants and having a great time\, and I hate writing such a negative review\, but I had to share my experience\, especially for a restaurant that is getting an awful lot of (undeserved) hype."
"customer349.json","Great food for the price. \nTender steak and perfectly cooked shrimp. \nWould certainly come back."
"customer350.json","We stopped at Tako due to the positive reviews on yelp. We brought a bottle of white wine with us\, the staff did not bring a ice or a chill bucket for us. It took 45 minutes for our appetizers to come out. The edamame was over cooked and mushy while the spring roll did not look appetizing almost like it was frozen. I could buy better spring rolls from trader joes.\nNext we moved on to our sushi which was sat on the sushi bar for 15 minutes before it was brought to us. The sushi it self was good\, but not the best I have ever had\,\nIf I came here again I would not buy any appetizers. The service was slow"
